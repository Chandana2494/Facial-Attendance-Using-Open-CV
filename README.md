# Face_recognition_based_attendance_system
A Python-based attendance system that uses face recognition for real-time student attendance tracking.

In this project, I built a face-recognition attendance application with a clean and simple GUI so anyone can operate it easily. The system captures faces, trains the model, and automatically marks attendance with date and time. The entire interface is developed using Tkinter, and face recognition is powered by OpenCV.

TECHNOLOGY USED:

1.Python Tkinter – Developed the complete Graphical User Interface (GUI)

2.OpenCV (LBPH Face Recognizer) – Used for capturing images and performing face detection + recognition

3.(cv2.face.LBPHFaceRecognizer_create())

FEATURES:

1.Simple and interactive GUI for smooth usage and navigation.
2.Password-protected student registration to prevent unauthorized entries.
3.Automatically stores and updates student details in a CSV database.
4.Daily attendance tracking with date & time — creates a new CSV file each day.
5.Live attendance view on the main screen with ID, Name, Date, and Time in a table format.
